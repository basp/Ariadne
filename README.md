# Ariadne.jl
Playing around with mazes. And Julia. Mostly Julia.

### A small note about style
Right of the bat, since there's not really a definitive style guide for Julia it should be noted that most of the code tries to confirm to [Flux guidelines](http://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/v0.19.0/style/) since they make sense and are the most complete we have right now.
