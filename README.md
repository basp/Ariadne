# Ariadne.jl
A toolkit for playing around with mazes. And Julia. Mostly Julia though.

#### Style
Since there's not really a definitive style guide for Julia, most of the code tries to confirm to [Flux guidelines](http://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/v0.19.0/style/) since they make sense and are the most complete we have right now.
